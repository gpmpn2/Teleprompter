This is international news as this is the first time a cat has done something besides slept on a couch. This cat 'Jeremy' will when a nobel prize for its efforts.\n\nA turtle named george has just discovered the secret behind anti-matter and is attempting to send a space ship to a black hole. Will we ever discover if there is life on Mars, who knows. I only know that the poptart I made this morning has strawberry filling. Donuts are really tasty and my favorite are chocolate ones, those are the best. I went to the zoo and saw a tiger eat a deer the other day, I don't think the zookeepers are doing their jobs very well.\n\nWelcome to mid morning news with your co anchor jim halpert.
